    description: Demonstrates the use of asynchronous, background processes with Panel
    description_long: |-
      When creating awesome analytics apps you sometimes wants to run jobs in the background or provide
      streaming analytics to your users.
      Panel also supports these use cases as its running on top of the asynchronous web server Tornado.
      Below we show case how to start a background thread that updates a progressbar while
      the rest of the application remains responsive.
      This example is based on the discussion [Can I load data asynchronously in Panel?](https://discourse.holoviz.org/t/can-i-load-data-asynchronously-in-panel/452).
      If you really deep dive into this, then you can study

    description: An app demonstrating how to speed up your app using caching.
    description_long: |-
      In computing, a *cache* is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data,
      typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than
      is possible by accessing the data’s primary storage location.
      **Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data** to
      **speed up your exploration, jobs or apps**.
      Good caching solutions for Panel are summarized in the table below

      |Technology           |  Performance | Persistant | Horizontal Scaling | Vertical Scaling | Expiration | Preloading | Comments                           |
      |---------------------|--------------|------------|--------------------| -----------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|-|
      |`panel.state.cache` | Very Fast | No | No | Yes | No | No | Simple Dict Cache |
      |[DiskCache](https://pypi.org/project/diskcache/) | Very Fast | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |  Simple Persistent Cache |
      |[Redis](https://redis.io/) | Very Fast | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Server solution. Works well with the distributed task queue [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/index.html)  |
      
      Note that
      
      - *Expiration* enables caching data for a period of time for example seconds, minutes, hours or
      days.
      - *Preloading* of a cache can be triggered by a cronjob or event.
      - If the cache is *persisted*, i.e. stored to disk or runs on a server like Redis it can enable
      caching data across jobs, applications, servers and restarts.

      Panel does not style a `panel.widgets.DataFrame` by default.
      A user can specify some Formatters like `Numberformatter`, `Stringformater` etc
      `from bokeh.models.widgets.tables` manually. But this takes time, so I consider this *friction*.
      
      In the [`awesome_panel_extensions.widgets.dataframe`](https://pypi.org/project/awesome-panel-extensions/#:~:text=Panel%20is%20a%20framework%20for,to%20the%20power%20of%20Panel.&text=If%20you%20wan't%20to%20learn%20more%20checkout%20the%20Package%20Documentation.)
      module we lower the friction by providing functionality for sensible defaults.

      - Implementing some basic tests

      The Panel [FileInput](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/widgets/FileInput.html#widgets-gallery-FileInput)

      Here we style the FileInput to make it look like a more modern file upload area that
      **SUPPORTS DRAG AND DROP**.
      This is done by adding the below css and settings `css_classes=["pnx-file-upload-area"]` on
      the `FileInput` widget.
      
      ```css
      .pnx-file-upload-area input[type=file] {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        border: 3px dashed #9E9E9E;
        background: transparent;
        border-radius: 5px;
        text-align: left;

      [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org/index.html) is an open-source Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple. With HoloViews, you can usually express what you want to do in very few lines of code, letting you focus on what you are trying to explore and convey, not on the process of plotting.

      You can use any of the backends [Bokeh](lib_bokeh), [Matplotlib](lib_matplotlib) and

      HoloViews is harder to learn than and less robust than Plotly.

      Google has developed the `model-viewer` web component for interactively viewing very large and

      The ModelViewer component and example could potentially be extended a lot by giving access to all
      the parameters of the `model-viewer`.

    description: A Streaming Indicators Dashboard
    description_long: |-
      This example shows a streaming indicators dashboard.
      
      Panel runs on top of the Tornado server. Tornado is a fast, asynchronous web server built to
      support streaming use cases.
      
      In panel it's very easy to support periodic updates. Here it's done via
      `pn.state.add_periodic_callback`

      Streaming is something that Panel supports really well
      This application demonstrates how to use
      [Streamz](https://streamz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
      [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
      [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html),
      [Holoviews](https://holoviews.org/),
      [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/),
      [Echart](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) and
      [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) for streaming.
      The stream will STOP AFTER 1 MINUTE.

    description: Demonstrates the powerful Tabulator Table
    description_long: |-
      [Tabulator](http://tabulator.info/) is a very powerful interactive javascript Table.
      Panel provides the [`Tabulator`](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/layouts/Tabs.html) widget.
      
      The widget was first implemented and contributed by `awesome-panel.org`. Later Philipp did massive
      improvements. It is now one of the most powerful widgets in Panel.

      `Tabulator.patch` is currently broken. Please upvote [#3084](https://github.com/holoviz/panel/issues/3084)
      if you also would like it fixed.
