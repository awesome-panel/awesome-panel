# Home of Awesome Panel ![Awesome Badge](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)

Panel is announced as **a high-level app and dashboarding solution for Python**. I think the terms **powerful** and **full of features** should be added to that.

The purpose of the Awesome Panel Project is to share knowledge on how Awesome Panel is and can become.

I believe easy to use and powerful frameworks for developing awesome, interactive tools and apps by and for domain experts like analysts, engineers and scientists using the power of Python has a huge potential.

I believe Panel could be such an easy to use and powerful framework. But it is not receiving the attentation that it deserves.

- Partially because its not really been communicated widely.
- Partly because there is a little bit of friction to using all the powerful features.

My hope is that this can help spread the word and lower the friction.

This application provides

- A curated list of awesome Panel **resources**.
- A **gallery** of awesome panel applications.
- This app as a **best practice multi page app** with a nice layout developed in Panel.

This page does not render nicely in Internet Explorer and it's not supported.

## The Power of Panel

The only way to truly understand how powerful Panel is to play around with it. But if you need to be convinced first, then take a look at the first **4 minutes** of this **introduction to Panel**. The video is by **Philipp Rudiger**, the creator of Panel.

Afterwards you can go to the [Panel Getting Started Guide](http://panel.pyviz.org/getting_started/index.html) or visit the [Panel Gallery](http://panel.pyviz.org/gallery/index.html) and the [Panel Reference Gallery](https://panel.pyviz.org/reference/index.html).
