[caching_example]

introduction = """An app demonstrating how to speed up your app using caching."""
description = """
In computing, a *cache* is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data,
typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than
is possible by accessing the data’s primary storage location.

**Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data** to
**speed up your exploration, jobs or apps**.

Good caching solutions for Panel are summarized in the table below

|Technology           |  Performance | Persistant | Horizontal Scaling | Vertical Scaling | Expiration | Preloading | Comments                           |
|---------------------|--------------|------------|--------------------| -----------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|-|
|`panel.state.cache` | Very Fast | No | No | Yes | No | No | Simple Dict Cache |
|[DiskCache](https://pypi.org/project/diskcache/) | Very Fast | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |  Simple Persistent Cache |
|[Redis](https://redis.io/) | Very Fast | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Server solution. Works well with the distributed task queue [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/index.html)  |

Note that

- *Expiration* enables caching data for a period of time for example seconds, minutes, hours or
days.
- *Preloading* of a cache can be triggered by a cronjob or event.
- If the cache is *persisted*, i.e. stored to disk or runs on a server like Redis it can enable
caching data across jobs, applications, servers and restarts.

To learn more about caching check out the [AWS Caching Overview](https://aws.amazon.com/caching/)
