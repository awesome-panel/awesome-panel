### 💻 Install for Development

To install for development you will need to create a new environment

Then run

pn test all
```

Please run this command and fix any failing tests if possible before you `git push`.

mkdir -p apps/dev/www
mkdir -p apps/prod/www
panel serve examples/*.py examples/*.ipynb --glob --num-procs 4 --num-threads 0 --index home.py --static-dirs apps-dev=apps/dev/www apps=apps/prod/www

### 🚢 Release a new package on Pypi
