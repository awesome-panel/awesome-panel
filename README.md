## üöÄ Get started in under a minute

Install `awesome-panel` including the *`examples` dependencies*.

```bash
pip install awesome-panel[examples]
```

Explore the sample apps by running

```bash
pn hello awesome-panel
```

and opening [http://localhost:5007/gallery](http://localhost:5007/gallery) in your browser.

You can find the sample apps in the `examples/awesome-panel/awesome-panel` folder.

### üòÖ Install geopandas on windows

On Windows you unfortunately have to install the [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) package your self as described in [using-geopandas-windows](https://geoffboeing.com/2014/09/using-geopandas-windows/). This is only required to be able to explore a small subset of the applications.

### üìÅ Download the examples only

You can download the example files only, i.e. without installing all the python packages, via

```bash
pip install awesome-panel awesome-panel-cli
```

```bash
pn examples awesome-panel
```
