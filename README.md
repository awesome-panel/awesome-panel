## The Power of Panel

The only way to truly understand how powerfull Panel is to play around with it. But if you need to be convinced first, then here is the **30 minute introduction** to Panel!

Afterwards you can go to the [Panel Getting Started Guide](http://panel.pyviz.org/getting_started/index.html) or visit the [Panel Gallery](http://panel.pyviz.org/gallery/index.html).

## Getting Started with the Awesome Panel Repository

### Prerequisites

- An Operating System like Windows, OsX or Linux
- A working [Python](https://www.python.org/) installation.
    - We recommend using 64bit Python 3.7.4.
- a Shell
    - We recommend [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for Windows 8.1
    - We recommend [wsl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) for For Windows 10
- an Editor
    - We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Preferred) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
- The [Git cli](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-panel.git
```

cd into the project root folder

```bash
cd awesome-panel
```

#### Create virtual environment

##### via python

Then you should create a virtual environment named .venv

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

and activate the environment.

On Linux, OsX or in a Windows Git Bash terminal it's

```bash
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

or alternatively

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

In a Windows terminal it's

```bash
.venv/Scripts/activate.bat
```

##### or via Anaconda

Create virtual environment named awesome-panel

```bash
conda create -n awesome-panel python=3.7.4
```

and activate environment.

```bash
activate awesome-panel
```

Then you should install the local requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements_local.txt
```

### Build and run the Application Locally

```bash
panel serve app.py
```

or in a jupyter notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook app.ipynb
```

or as a Docker container via

```bash
invoke docker.build --rebuild
invoke docker.run-server
```

### Run the Application using the image on Dockerhub

If you don't wan't to clone the repo and build the docker container you can just use `docker run` to run the image from [Dockerhub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/marcskovmadsen/repository/docker/marcskovmadsen/awesome-panel)

To run the panel interactively on port 80

```bash
docker run -it -p 80:80 marcskovmadsen/awesome-panel:latest
```

To run bash interactively

```bash
docker run -it -p 80:80 --entrypoint "/bin/bash" marcskovmadsen/awesome-panel:latest
```

## Building and Deploy the Awesome Panel Package

You can build the package using

```bash
cd package
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

If you wan't to publish the package to PyPi you should first

update the version number in the setup.py file. The format is `YYYYmmdd.version`. For example `20191208.1`

Then you run

```bash
twine upload dist/awesome-panel-YYYYmmdd.version.tar.gz -u <the-pypi-username> -p <the-pypi-password>
```

### Code quality and Tests

We use

- [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) for sorting import statements
- [autoflake](https://github.com/myint/autoflake) to remove unused imports and unused variables
- [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) the opinionated code formatter
- [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) for static analysis
- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) for static type checking
- [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) for unit to functional tests

to ensure a high quality of our code and application.

You can run all tests using

```bash
invoke test.all
```

### Workflow

We use the power of [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) to semi-automate the local workflow. You can see the list of available commands using

```bash
$ invoke --list

### Project Layout

The basic layout of a application is as simple as

```bash
.
└── app.py
```

As our application grows we would refactor our app.py file into multiple folders and files.

- *assets* here we keep our css and images assets.
- *models* - Defines the layout of our data in the form of
    - Classes: Name, attribute names, types
    - DataFrame Schemas: column and index names, dtypes
    - SQLAlchemy Tables: columns names, types
- *pages* - Defines the different pages of the Panel app
- *services* - Organizes and shares business logic, models, data and functions with different pages of the Panel App.
    - Database interactions: Select, Insert, Update, Delete
    - REST API interactions, get, post, put, delete
    - Pandas transformations

and end up with a project structure like

```bash
.
├── app.py
└── src
    └── assets
    |    └── css
    |    |   ├── app.css
    |    |   ├── component1.css
    |    |   ├── component2.css
    |    |   ├── page1.css
    |    |   └── page2.css
    |    └── images
    |    |   ├── image1.png
    |    |   └── image2.png
    ├── core
    |   └── services
    |       ├── service1.py
    |       └── service2.py
    └── pages
    |   ├── page1.py
    |   └── page2.py
    └── shared
        └── models
        |   ├── model1.py
        |   └── model2.py
        └── components
            ├── component1.py
            └── component2.py
```

Further refactoring is guided by by [this](https://itnext.io/choosing-a-highly-scalable-folder-structure-in-angular-d987de65ec7) blog post and the [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide).

We place our tests in a `test` folder in the root folder organized with folders similar to the `app` folder and file names with a `test_` prefix.

```bash
.
└── test
    ├── test_app.py
    ├── core
    |   └── services
    |       ├── test_service1.py
    |       └── test_service2.py
    └── pages
    |   └── pages
    |       ├── page1
    |       |   └── test_page1.py
    |       └── page2
    └── shared
        └── models
        |   ├── test_model1.py
        |   └── test_model2.py
        └── components
            ├── test_component1.py
            └── test_component2.py
```
