## Introduction

When creating awesome analytics apps you sometimes want to run blocking tasks asynchronously in a background thread. Panel supports this as its running on top of the asynchronous web server Tornado.

The app below shows how to start a background thread that updates a progressbar while the rest of the application remains responsive. We utilize a [`ThreadPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor) and *async* to achieve this.
