## Pyodide Apps

We distribute most of our apps as apps that run entirely in the browser via [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) and [panel convert](https://panel.holoviz.org/how_to/wasm/convert.html). We do this because we don't have the resources to pay for and maintain servers. They do take longer time to load than apps server on a server.
